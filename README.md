# React Router Tutorial Exercise
## Project #49 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
This project introduced me to routing - using the current browser URL to determine what content to show a user. React Router v5 was installed, as v6 introduced changes that break the starter code.
## What I Learned
  - Installing react-router-dom from the terminal
  - Enabling routing by wrapping contents in the BrowserRouter component
  - Adding routes with the Route component
  - Static routes (without URL parameters, e.g. /users)
  - Dynamic routes (with URL parameters, e.g. /users/:userId)
  - Using the useParams hook to access the values of URL parameters
  - Declaratively redirecting users by rendering the Redirect component
  - Imperatively redirecting users by accessing the history object via the useHistory hook and calling its methods (goForward, goBack, push)
  - Accessing the value of query parameters using the useLocation hook
